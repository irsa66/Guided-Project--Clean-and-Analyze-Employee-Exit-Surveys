# Guided-Project--Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

In this guided project by Dataquest, I'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia to answer the question "Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?".
